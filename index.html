				<p class="home--introduction">This is my personal website, I'm a sofware developer from Brazil with a disposition towards back-end development
				and networking stuff. I display here in this humble personal website my projects and opinions on technology related topics.<p>
				<h1 class="home--welcome">About me</h1>
				<p class="home--introduction">I've been working in the industry for almost 2 years now, mostly working with PHP, node or python on the back-end
					and Vue.js on the front-end, but I'm always eager to learn new stuff as the undertaking demands. I generally use languages with open environments
					and permissive licenses for my personal projects too, be them web-based or otherwise.
				</p>
				<h1 class="home--welcome">About this website</h1>
				<p class="home--introduction">It's supposed to be a portfolio/personal website/blog hybrid. I will post here my projects and comments
					about them, opinion pieces on technology, tips and tricks about stuff I used to struggle with in the past, and everything else
					I feel like posting. It is purposefully simple and small
					(as this kind of website should be), but beware: The deceiving simplicity hides secrets within its metaphorical walls...
